# Minesweeper
That was my first object oriented programm in C++
# What needs to be done
- I want to upgrade menu system so the user could choose the size of the board from inside of the programm
- I need to clean the head files beacause every class is defined in minesweeperBoard.h file
- Also this program still needs additional features to actualy work like a minesweeper (opening every cell that does not touch the bomb)
- Maybe some GUI but i dont really want to go this way with my programming skills
